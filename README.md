Low Latency Efficient Adaptive Robust Neural Code, ICC 2019

Sorry for this delay, I have been interning and dealing with other things. We are planing to some further submission, which makes the code very drafty and has a lot of not necessary parts.

You can email me at yij021@uw.edu for the very drafty code.

Just noticed that I might missed a few emails when I am in China, some wired issue on my email account.
